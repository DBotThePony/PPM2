# Features
 * Fully customizable ponies! Even **more customizable than you think**! Just checkout advanced mode in editor!
 * Total code rewrite; now all functions are working on Event Oriented Programming; it means that PPM/2 can work much faster with more features included when compared to original PPM
 * New models - it allows to add huge amount of manes and tails
 * Multisupport - Don't worry! PPM/2 supports **three** various ponies models. It includes the new one; the CPPM one and the old one; no needs to remake your PACs!
 * Flexes - **YES!** your ponies now show their feelings! Sad; anger; fear and other emotes you can see on new ponies models! Also you can use them in your PACs!
 * Out-of-box support for URL textures. You can now throw away the PAC3 submaterial parts, because PPM/2 already allows you to put URL textures on pony parts!
 * Yes; you can import the old data.
 * On new models, manes and tails works as separated models; like TF2 hats.
